- [**IEEE 802.15.4-2015**](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_15_4-2015.html): The currently active PHY + MAC layer standard for 802.15.4 networks. Although this is the official standard, many developers seem to have a total disregard for certain aspects of it. Especially on the Sub-GHz PHY layers, there seems to be a lot of confusion as to what is actually standardised and what is not. The fact that IEEE standards are very expensive to obtain doesn't help this confusion either.

We make no mistake about it, seasoned embedded developers would probably have a heart-attack looking at parts of our code, but the important thing to remember is that we're well on our way to write better source code and this book is what's getting us there.
